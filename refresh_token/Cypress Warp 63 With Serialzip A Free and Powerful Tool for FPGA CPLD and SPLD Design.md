# How to Use Cypress Warp 6.3 With Serial.zip to Program PLDs
 
Cypress Warp 6.3 is a powerful development environment for programmable logic devices (PLDs) such as small PLDs, MAX340 EPLDs, FLASH370, Ultra37000, Delta39K and Quantum 38K CPLDs[^1^] [^2^]. It allows users to describe electronic designs using VHDL and then compile and synthesize those descriptions to program Cypress devices[^2^].

Once you have downloaded the file, right-click on it and select "Extract Here" or "Extract to Cypress Warp 6.3 With Serial". You will see a folder named "Cypress Warp 6.3 With Serial" with several files inside.
 
## Step 2: Install Cypress Warp 6.3
 
The next step is to install Cypress Warp 6.3 on your PC. To do this, open the folder "Cypress Warp 6.3 With Serial" and double-click on the file "setup.exe". This will launch the installation wizard that will guide you through the process.
 
Follow the instructions on the screen and accept the license agreement. When prompted for the serial number, enter the one that is provided in the file "serial.txt" in the same folder. You can also copy and paste it from there.
 
Choose the destination folder for the installation and select the components that you want to install. We recommend installing all of them, as they are necessary for using Cypress Warp 6.3. The installation may take a few minutes, depending on your system.
 
## Step 3: Run Cypress Warp 6.3
 
After the installation is complete, you can run Cypress Warp 6.3 from your Start menu or desktop shortcut. You will see a splash screen with the logo of Cypress and then a main window with several menus and toolbars.
 
Cypress Warp 6.3 consists of three main components: the Warp VHDL compiler, the FSM editor and the Active-HDL Sim simulator[^2^]. You can access them from the menu "Tools" or from their respective icons on the toolbar.
 
### The Warp VHDL Compiler
 
The Warp VHDL compiler allows you to write VHDL code for your PLD designs and compile it into JEDEC files that can be mapped onto programmable devices[^2^]. You can create a new project from the menu "File" > "New" > "Project" or open an existing one from "File" > "Open" > "Project".
 
You can add VHDL files to your project from the menu "Project" > "Add Files" or by dragging and dropping them from your file explorer. You can edit your VHDL code using the built-in editor or your preferred external editor.
 
To compile your project, select it from the project tree on the left panel and click on the icon "Compile Project" on the toolbar or press F9. You will see a message window with the compilation status and any errors or warnings that may occur.
 
If your compilation is successful, you will see a JEDEC file in your project folder with the same name as your project. This is the file that you can use to program your PLD device using a programmer such as CY3670 or CY3671[^2^].
 
### The FSM Editor
 
The FSM editor allows you to create finite state machines (FSMs
