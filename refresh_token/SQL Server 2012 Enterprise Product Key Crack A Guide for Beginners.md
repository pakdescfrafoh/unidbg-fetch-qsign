If you are looking for a powerful and reliable database management system, you might want to consider SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition. This edition offers advanced features such as high availability, scalability, security, business intelligence, and data warehousing. However, upgrading to this edition requires a valid product key that you can purchase from Microsoft or an authorized reseller.

In this article, we will show you how to upgrade to SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition from a lower edition using the SQL Server Installation Center. Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
 
- A running instance of SQL Server 2012 in a lower edition (such as Standard or Web)
- The SQL Server 2012 installation media or a network share that contains the setup files
- A product key for SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition (you can find one in [^1^])
- Administrative privileges on the computer where you want to perform the upgrade
- A backup of your databases and system settings in case something goes wrong

Once you have everything ready, follow these steps to upgrade your SQL Server instance:

1. Insert the SQL Server installation media or locate the setup files on the network share.
2. From the root folder, double-click setup.exe or launch the SQL Server Installation Center from Configuration Tools.
3. To upgrade an existing instance of SQL Server to a different edition, from the SQL Server Installation Center select Maintenance, and then select Edition Upgrade.
4. If Setup support files are required, SQL Server Setup installs them. If you are instructed to restart your computer, restart before you continue.
5. The System Configuration Checker runs a discovery operation on your computer. To continue, select OK.
6. On the Product Key page, select a radio button to indicate whether you are upgrading to a free edition of SQL Server, or whether you have a PID key for a production version of the product. Enter your product key for SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition and click Next.
7. On the License Terms page, read the license agreement, and then select the check box to accept the licensing terms and conditions. To continue, select Next. To end Setup, select Cancel.
8. On the Select Instance page, specify the instance of SQL Server to upgrade. The Edition Upgrade Rules page validates your computer configuration before the edition upgrade operation begins.
9. To continue with the upgrade process, click Next. The Ready to Upgrade Edition page shows a tree view of installation options that were specified during Setup. To continue, click Upgrade.
10. The Upgrade Progress page shows status information for each component that is being upgraded. After all components are upgraded successfully, click Next.
11. The Complete page indicates that the edition upgrade process is finished. Click Close to exit Setup.

Congratulations! You have successfully upgraded your SQL Server instance to Enterprise Edition. To activate the new features and settings, you must restart your SQL Server services or failover to a different node if you are using a failover cluster instance. You can also verify your new edition by running the following query in SQL Server Management Studio:
