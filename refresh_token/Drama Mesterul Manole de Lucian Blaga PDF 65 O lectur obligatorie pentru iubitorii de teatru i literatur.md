Manole loved his wife dearly, but he also wanted to fulfill his artistic vision and impress his patron. He decided to follow the dream's advice and tricked Ana into coming to the construction site. He then bricked her up alive in the wall, while she begged him to spare her. The monastery was finally completed, but Manole and his workers were trapped on the roof by the patron, who wanted to prevent them from building anything more beautiful. Manole and his workers tried to escape by flying with wooden wings, but they all fell to their deaths.
 
The play by Lucian Blaga adds more depth and complexity to the legend. Blaga portrays Manole as a tormented genius who struggles with his moral dilemma and his artistic ambition. He also depicts Ana as a strong and loyal woman who accepts her fate and encourages Manole to finish his work. Blaga also introduces other characters, such as the patron's daughter who falls in love with Manole, the priest who questions Manole's faith, and the angel who guides Manole's destiny.
  
Drama Mesterul Manole by Lucian Blaga is not only a literary work, but also a cultural phenomenon. The play has inspired many artists and intellectuals to create their own interpretations and adaptations of the legend. For example, the Romanian composer George Enescu wrote an opera based on the play, which premiered in 1958. The Romanian painter Nicolae Grigorescu painted a famous scene from the play, showing Manole and Ana embracing before her immurement. The Romanian poet Nichita Stanescu wrote a poem called "Mesterul Manole", which expresses his admiration for Blaga's play.
