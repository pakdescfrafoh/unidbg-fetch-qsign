## Step 1: Download the Driver Mouse Rexus G7
 
The first step is to download the driver software from the official website of Rexus. You can find the link to the software page in the reference section below[^1^]. On the software page, scroll down until you see the section for "Mouse". Then, look for the model name "Rexus Xierra G7" and click on the "Download" button next to it. This will start downloading a zip file containing the driver software.
  
## Step 2: Extract and Run the Driver Mouse Rexus G7
 
Once you have downloaded the zip file, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can right-click on the zip file and choose "Extract Here" or "Extract to Rexus Xierra G7/" depending on your program. This will create a folder with the same name as the zip file. Inside the folder, you will find an executable file named "Rexus Xierra G7.exe". Double-click on this file to run the driver software.
  
## Step 3: Connect and Configure Your Rexus G7 Mouse
 
Before you run the driver software, make sure that your Rexus G7 mouse is connected to your computer via USB. Then, when you run the software, you will see a window with several tabs and options. You can use these tabs and options to configure various aspects of your mouse, such as:
 
- DPI: You can adjust the sensitivity of your mouse by choosing one of the four preset DPI levels (800/1600/3200/6400) or by customizing your own DPI value. You can also assign different DPI levels to different profiles and switch between them using the DPI button on your mouse.
- Button: You can assign different functions or macros to each of the seven buttons on your mouse. You can choose from a list of predefined functions (such as forward/backward, copy/paste, media control, etc.) or create your own macros using the macro manager. You can also assign different button settings to different profiles and switch between them using the profile button on your mouse.
- Light: You can adjust the RGB lighting effects of your mouse by choosing one of the six preset modes (breathing, neon, wave, rainbow, static, off) or by customizing your own color and brightness. You can also sync the lighting effects with other Rexus devices using the sync option.
- Advanced: You can fine-tune some advanced settings of your mouse, such as polling rate, double click speed, scroll speed, pointer speed, etc.

After you have made your desired changes, click on the "Apply" button at the bottom right corner of the window to save them. You can also click on the "Restore" button to reset all settings to default.
