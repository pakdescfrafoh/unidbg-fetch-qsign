## How to Create a Simple 3D Model with HD Online Player (Jdpaint 5 55 13)
 
To create a simple 3D model with HD Online Player (Jdpaint 5 55 13), you need to follow these steps:

1. When you launch the software, you will see two windows: one for playing audio files from SoundCloud, and one for Jdpaint.
2. In the Jdpaint window, click on the File menu and select New.
3. A dialog box will appear, where you can choose the size and resolution of your model. For this example, we will use a size of 100 x 100 x 10 mm and a resolution of 0.1 mm. Click OK.
4. You will see a blank canvas in the Jdpaint window. You can use the tools on the left panel to draw and sculpt your model. For example, you can use the Pencil tool to draw lines, curves, or shapes; the Brush tool to add or remove material; the Smoothing tool to smooth out rough edges; and the Transform tool to move, rotate, or scale your model.
5. For this example, we will draw a simple star shape using the Pencil tool. To do this, click on the Pencil tool icon and then click on the canvas to start drawing. You can hold down the Shift key to draw straight lines. To finish drawing, double-click on the canvas or press Enter.
6. You will see a thin line on the canvas representing your star shape. To make it thicker, you can use the Brush tool. Click on the Brush tool icon and then click on the line. You can adjust the size and strength of the brush using the sliders on the right panel. You can also change the shape of the brush using the drop-down menu on the right panel.
7. To make your star shape more realistic, you can use the Smoothing tool. Click on the Smoothing tool icon and then click on your model. You can adjust the strength of the smoothing using the slider on the right panel.
8. You can also add some details to your star shape using other tools like Eraser, Emboss, Carve, etc. Experiment with different tools and settings until you are satisfied with your model.
