In the previous section, you learned that there are two kinds of emitters in Particle Designer: regular emitters and super emitters. A regular emitter is a simple emitter that can create particles of different shapes, colors, sizes, and behaviors. A super emitter is a complex emitter that can create multiple free emitters, each with their own particles and properties. A free emitter is an emitter that can move independently from its parent super emitter.
 
When you want to edit the parameters of an emitter or a particle, you need to use the Controls View. This is where you can adjust various settings such as position, velocity, rotation, lifespan, color, texture, and so on. However, before you start tweaking the parameters in the Controls View, you need to understand how the emitters and particles are organized and related to each other. The best way to see this is by using the Nodes View.

The Nodes View is a graphical representation of the hierarchy of emitters and particles in your project. It shows you which emitters and particles are nested inside which other emitters and particles. You can use the Nodes View to select, add, delete, duplicate, or reorder emitters and particles. You can also use it to switch between different views of your project.
  
Let's take a closer look at the Nodes View and see how it works. The Nodes View consists of two main parts: the node tree and the node inspector. The node tree is a vertical list of nodes that represent emitters and particles. The node inspector is a horizontal panel that shows the properties of the selected node.

The node tree has a root node that represents the entire project. Below the root node, you can see the emitters and particles that belong to your project. Each emitter node has a small icon that indicates its type: regular or super. Each particle node has a small thumbnail that shows its texture. You can expand or collapse an emitter node by clicking on the arrow next to it. You can select a node by clicking on it. You can also drag and drop nodes to reorder them or change their parent-child relationship.
 
The node inspector shows the parameters of the selected node in the node tree. Depending on the type of the node, you can see different tabs and settings in the node inspector. For example, if you select an emitter node, you can see tabs such as General, Position, Rotation, Emission, and so on. If you select a particle node, you can see tabs such as General, Color, Size, Rotation, and so on. You can change the values of the parameters by using sliders, text fields, color pickers, or buttons.
  
Now that you know how to use the Nodes View and the Controls View, you can start creating and editing emitters and particles in your project. To add a new emitter or particle, you can use the buttons at the bottom of the Nodes View. You can choose from a list of predefined templates or create a custom one. To delete an emitter or particle, you can select it and press the delete key or use the button at the bottom of the Nodes View. To duplicate an emitter or particle, you can select it and press the command + D keys or use the button at the bottom of the Nodes View.
 
To edit an emitter or particle, you can select it and use the Controls View to change its parameters. You can also use the Preview Window to see how your emitter or particle looks and behaves in real time. The Preview Window is a large area that shows your project as a simulation. You can zoom in or out, pan, rotate, or reset the view by using the buttons at the top of the Preview Window. You can also pause, play, or restart the simulation by using the buttons at the bottom of the Preview Window.
 
To save your project, you can use the File menu and choose Save or Save As. You can also export your project as a plist file that can be used in other applications such as Cocos2d-x or SpriteKit. To export your project, you can use the File menu and choose Export. You can also preview your project on your device by using the Device menu and choosing Connect Device. You will need to install Particle Designer on your device and connect it to your Mac via USB.
