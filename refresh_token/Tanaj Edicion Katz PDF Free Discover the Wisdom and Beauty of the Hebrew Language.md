# Tanaj Edicion Katz: A Spanish Translation of the Hebrew Bible
 
The Tanaj Edicion Katz is a Spanish translation of the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Tanakh or the Old Testament. It is based on the Masoretic text and follows the Jewish division and order of the books. It was published by Editorial Jerusalen de Mexico in 2004 and consists of four volumes: Pentateuco (Torah), Profetas Anteriores (Nevi'im Rishonim), Profetas Posteriores (Nevi'im Aharonim) and Escritos (Ketuvim).
 
The translation was done by Rabbi Michael Katz and Rabbi Yechiel Sitzman, who aimed to preserve the original meaning and style of the Hebrew text as much as possible. They also added comments and explanations from various Jewish sources, such as the Talmud, the Midrash, the Rashi commentary and others. The translation also includes introductions, maps, charts, tables and appendices that provide additional information and context for the readers.

The Tanaj Edicion Katz is a valuable resource for Spanish-speaking Jews who want to study and understand the Hebrew Bible in their own language. It is also useful for non-Jews who are interested in learning more about the Jewish faith and culture. The translation is available online for free download or viewing on Scribd[^1^] [^3^], or for purchase on various websites[^2^].

One of the advantages of the Tanaj Edicion Katz is that it preserves the Jewish perspective and tradition of the Hebrew Bible, which is often lost or distorted in other Spanish translations. For example, some translations use terms that are more familiar to Christians, such as "Antiguo Testamento" (Old Testament) instead of "Tanaj", or "MesÃ­as" (Messiah) instead of "Mashiaj". Other translations may also reflect theological biases or doctrinal interpretations that are not faithful to the original text.
 
Among the most widely used Spanish translations of the Bible are the Reina-Valera versions, which date back to the 16th century and are based on the Textus Receptus, a Greek manuscript that differs from the Masoretic text in some places. The Reina-Valera versions are considered the Spanish equivalent of the King James Version and are popular among Spanish-speaking Protestants. The most common Reina-Valera version is the 1960 revision[^1^].
 
Another popular Spanish translation is the Nueva Version Internacional (NVI), which was produced by Biblica in 1979 following the NIV translation principles. The NVI is a dynamic equivalence translation that seeks to convey the meaning and style of the original languages in contemporary Spanish. The NVI is widely used by Spanish-speaking Evangelicals and has been endorsed by several Christian leaders and organizations[^2^].
 
Other Spanish translations include the Biblia Dios Habla Hoy (DHH), which is a common language translation that aims to make the Bible accessible and understandable to all people, especially those with little or no education; the La Palabra version, which is a literal translation that follows the Nestle-Aland Greek text and the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Hebrew text; and the Biblia del Oso, which is a facsimile edition of the first complete Bible printed in Spanish in 1569[^3^] [^4^].
