Computer graphics is the field of study that deals with the creation, manipulation and display of images using computers. Virtual reality is the technology that simulates a realistic or imaginary environment and allows the user to interact with it. Both computer graphics and virtual reality have many applications in various domains such as entertainment, education, engineering, medicine, etc.

- Graphics hardware: This chapter introduces the basic components and functions of a graphics system, such as video display devices, input devices, graphics cards, frame buffers, scan conversion, rasterization and antialiasing.
- Geometric transformations: This chapter explains the mathematical concepts and methods for transforming geometric objects in 2D and 3D space, such as translation, rotation, scaling, reflection, shear and composite transformations.
- 2D and 3D clipping: This chapter describes the algorithms and techniques for clipping 2D and 3D objects against a rectangular or polygonal window or viewport, such as Cohen-Sutherland algorithm, Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm, Cyrus-Beck algorithm and Liang-Barsky algorithm.
- Hidden surface removal: This chapter discusses the problem of determining which surfaces of a 3D object are visible from a given viewpoint and how to remove the hidden surfaces to avoid unnecessary computations and improve the realism of the image. Some of the methods presented are z-buffer algorithm, scan-line algorithm, painter's algorithm and BSP trees.
- Illumination models: This chapter introduces the physical and empirical models for simulating the effects of light on the appearance of objects, such as ambient light, diffuse reflection, specular reflection, Phong model and Gouraud shading.
- Shading techniques: This chapter explains how to assign colors to the pixels of an object based on its illumination model and viewing parameters, such as flat shading, smooth shading, Phong shading and Bui-Tuong Phong shading.
- Texture mapping: This chapter describes how to enhance the realism of an object by applying an image or a pattern to its surface, such as texture coordinates, texture filtering, mipmapping, bump mapping and displacement mapping.

The book also covers advanced topics such as ray tracing, animation, virtual reality devices, virtual reality modeling language (VRML), augmented reality and haptic systems. The book provides a balanced coverage of both theory and practice of computer graphics and virtual reality. The book is well-organized and easy to follow. The book is suitable for anyone who wants to learn more about computer graphics and virtual reality.
