- One option is to visit the official website of the author or publisher of the Panchangam and check if they offer a free PDF download. For example, Sri Iswaryambika Jyotisha Darshini offers a free 100 years Telugu Panchangam & Ephemeris on their website[^2^]. However, this option may not be available for all the authors or publishers.
- Another option is to search for the Panchangam on Scribd, a digital library that hosts millions of books, documents, and audiobooks. For example, you can find Gupta Satabhdi Panchagam 110 years on Scribd[^1^]. However, this option may require you to sign up for a free trial or a subscription to access the full PDF.
- A third option is to look for the Panchangam on other online platforms that share PDF files, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Mediafire, etc. For example, you can find Butte Veerabhadra 100 Years Panchangam PDF on Google Drive[^3^]. However, this option may involve some risks such as malware, viruses, or copyright infringement.

Whichever option you choose, make sure to verify the source and the content of the PDF before downloading it. Also, respect the rights and wishes of the authors and publishers and do not share or distribute the PDF without their permission.
