# What's New in KUKA.Sim Pro 2.2 19?
 
KUKA.Sim Pro is a powerful simulation software for offline programming of KUKA robots. It allows users to create a digital twin of their production process and optimize it with features such as reachability check, collision detection, cycle time analysis and virtual commissioning. KUKA.Sim Pro 2.2 19 is the latest version of the software that offers several improvements and new functionalities.
 
## Compatibility with Windows 7 and Windows 10
 
KUKA.Sim Pro 2.2 19 is compatible with Windows XP 32 Bit, Windows 7 32 Bit / 64 Bit and Windows 10 64 Bit operating systems. It can also work with KUKA.OfficeLite V8.2, which is a virtual controller that runs on a PC and simulates the behavior of a real KUKA robot controller. KUKA.OfficeLite V8.2 supports both KRC 4 (System software V8.2) and KRC 2 (System software V5.x / V7.x) robot controllers[^1^].

## Direct CAD Import
 
KUKA.Sim Pro 2.2 19 offers an optional feature for direct CAD import of various formats, such as STEP, Catia v4, Catia v5, Solidworks, ProE, Siemens NX, JT, Parasolid, IGES, ACIS and IDEAS[^1^]. This feature allows users to import CAD models directly into KUKA.Sim Pro without the need for intermediate conversion or export steps. This saves time and ensures data consistency.
 
## Animated 3D PDF Export
 
KUKA.Sim Pro 2.2 19 enables users to export their simulation scenes as animated 3D PDF files[^1^]. This feature allows users to share their simulation results with others who do not have KUKA.Sim Pro installed on their machines. The animated 3D PDF files can be viewed with any standard PDF reader that supports 3D content, such as Adobe Acrobat Reader.
 
## Other Improvements
 
KUKA.Sim Pro 2.2 19 also brings other improvements, such as:
 
- Large CAD model support (3 x better memory footprint)
- Faster rendering using improved rendering acceleration (2-4 x improvement)
- Topology information for snapping and picking geometry features
- Preliminary support for NURBS surface tessellation
- Faster collision checking incl. distance control
- Component locking support; Unit support for 3D world settings
- RRS2 enhancements (additional vrc\_connect and vrc\_disconnect option, IO handle state handling)
- Support of external TCP functionality (RSL-KRL)
- Quick access to âInteractâ with components from main toolbar
- API supports Python 2.5

KUKA.Sim Pro 2.2 19 is a simulation software that offers many advantages for planning, testing and optimizing robot applications before they are implemented in the real world. It is a flexible and durable tool that can be customized according to the user's needs and preferences.
