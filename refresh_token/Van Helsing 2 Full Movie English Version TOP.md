Van Helsing is a 2004 action horror movie directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Hugh Jackman as the legendary monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing. The movie follows Van Helsing as he teams up with Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) to stop Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) from unleashing an army of undead creatures on the world. The movie also features Frankenstein's monster, werewolves, vampires, and other iconic creatures from classic horror literature and films.

Van Helsing was a commercial success, grossing over $300 million worldwide, but received mixed to negative reviews from critics and audiences. The movie was criticized for its excessive use of CGI, lack of plot coherence, and poor characterization. Despite its flaws, the movie has gained a cult following among fans of action and horror genres.
 
Many fans have wondered if there will ever be a sequel to Van Helsing, or if the movie's ending left room for a continuation. The movie ends with Van Helsing killing Dracula and his brides, but also losing Anna in the process. He then returns to Rome with Carl (David Wenham), a friar who assists him in his missions, and Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley), who decides to leave them and find his own place in the world. The movie also hints at Van Helsing's mysterious past and his connection to Dracula, but never fully explains it.
 
Unfortunately, there has been no official confirmation of a Van Helsing 2 movie from the filmmakers or the studio. In fact, Stephen Sommers has stated that he has no plans to make a sequel, and that he considers Van Helsing a standalone story. He also said that he was disappointed by the negative reaction to the movie, and that he felt he had made a mistake by trying to please everyone.
 
However, there have been some attempts to expand the Van Helsing universe in other media forms. In 2005, a video game based on the movie was released for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, featuring Jackman and Beckinsale reprising their roles. The game follows an original storyline that takes place before the events of the movie, and introduces new characters and enemies. In 2016, a TV series called Van Helsing premiered on Syfy, starring Kelly Overton as Vanessa Helsing, a descendant of Gabriel who awakens in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by vampires. The series is loosely inspired by the movie and the original novels by Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley.

There have also been some fan-made trailers for Van Helsing 2 on YouTube, using footage from other movies and TV shows to create a hypothetical sequel. Some of these trailers include Van Helsing 2: Redemption[^1^], which imagines Van Helsing facing off against Lucifer; Best Horror Movies - Van Helsing 2 Action Movies Full Length English[^2^], which depicts Van Helsing fighting against a female vampire; and Van Helsing 2-full Movie 2017[^3^], which shows Van Helsing teaming up with Blade (Wesley Snipes) and Hellboy (Ron Perlman).
 
While these fan-made trailers are creative and entertaining, they are not official or authorized by the original creators of Van Helsing. Therefore, fans should not expect them to be accurate or realistic representations of what a potential sequel would look like.
 
In conclusion, there is no evidence that a Van Helsing 2 movie is in development or will ever be made. The movie's director has expressed his disinterest in making a sequel, and the studio has not announced any plans for one. However, fans can still enjoy the original movie and its spin-offs in other media forms, or watch some of the fan-made trailers for fun.
