The film follows the adventures of Capitao Falcao and his sidekick Puto Perdiz, who are loyal to the dictator Salazar and his regime. They fight against various enemies, such as communists, anarchists, feminists, hippies and homosexuals, who threaten the stability and morality of Portugal. Along the way, they encounter historical figures, such as Vladimir Lenin, Che Guevara and AmÃ¡lia Rodrigues.
 
The film is a homage and a spoof of the superhero genre, especially the 1960s Batman TV series, as well as the propaganda films of the Estado Novo era. The film uses a retro style, with colorful costumes, campy dialogue and exaggerated action scenes. The film also mocks the stereotypes and clichÃ©s of Portuguese culture and history, such as fado music, football, codfish and colonialism.
 
The film was well received by audiences and critics, who praised its originality, humor and production values. The film won several awards, such as the Audience Award at Fantasporto 2015 and the Best Feature Film Award at MOTELx 2015. The film also spawned a spin-off web series called Puto Perdiz: O HerÃ³i do Povo (Puto Perdiz: The People's Hero), which follows the adventures of Capitao Falcao's sidekick after the Carnation Revolution.

The film was inspired by a short film called CapitÃ£o FalcÃ£o: O HerÃ³i do Povo (Captain Falcon: The People's Hero), which was made by JoÃ£o LeitÃ£o and his friends in 2009 as a joke. The short film became viral on the internet and attracted the attention of producer Individeos, who decided to finance a feature-length film based on the same concept. The film was shot in 2012 and 2013, with a budget of 600,000 euros.
