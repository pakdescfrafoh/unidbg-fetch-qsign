Here are some steps that you can follow to fix the FIFA Manager 13 error GfxCore.dll:
 
1. Reinstall the game. Sometimes, the game files may get damaged or overwritten by other programs or updates. Reinstalling the game can restore the original files and fix any errors. Make sure you backup your save files before uninstalling the game.
2. Download and install the latest patch. The developers may have released a patch that fixes the GfxCore.dll error or improves the game's compatibility with your system. You can check for updates on the game's official website or through your online platform (such as Origin or Steam).
3. Download and replace the GfxCore.dll file. If the GfxCore.dll file is missing or corrupted, you can try to download a new one from a reliable source (such as [DLL-files.com](https://www.dll-files.com/gfxcore.dll.html)) and replace it in your game folder. Make sure you download the correct version (32-bit or 64-bit) that matches your system and game. To replace the file, follow these steps:
    - Locate your game folder (usually in C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\FIFA Manager 13).
    - Find and rename the existing GfxCore.dll file to something else (such as GfxCore.bak).
    - Copy and paste the new GfxCore.dll file into the same folder.
    - Restart your computer and launch the game.
4. Update your graphics card drivers. The GfxCore.dll error may also be caused by outdated or incompatible graphics card drivers. Updating your drivers can improve your system's performance and compatibility with the game. You can use a driver updater tool (such as Driver Booster) or visit your graphics card manufacturer's website (such as NVIDIA or AMD) to download and install the latest drivers for your model.
5. Run the game as an administrator. Sometimes, the game may not have enough permissions to access certain files or resources on your system. Running the game as an administrator can grant it full access and prevent any errors. To do this, follow these steps:
