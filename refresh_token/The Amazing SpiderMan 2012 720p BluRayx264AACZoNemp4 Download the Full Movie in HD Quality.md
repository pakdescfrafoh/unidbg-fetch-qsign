The film is a reboot of the previous Spider-Man trilogy directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire, which ended in 2007 with Spider-Man 3. The Amazing Spider-Man was directed by Marc Webb, who was known for his indie romantic comedy (500) Days of Summer. The film was written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves, based on a story by Vanderbilt. The film also features Denis Leary as Captain George Stacy, Gwen's father and a police officer; Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, Peter's guardians; Irrfan Khan as Rajit Ratha, Connors' employer; and Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz as Richard and Mary Parker, Peter's parents who disappeared when he was young.
 
The Amazing Spider-Man was released on July 3, 2012 in the United States and received mostly positive reviews from critics and audiences. The film was praised for its performances, especially Garfield's and Stone's chemistry; its action sequences; its visual effects; and its score by James Horner. The film was also criticized for some plot holes; its similarity to the original Spider-Man film; and its unnecessary 3D conversion. The film grossed over $758 million worldwide against a budget of $200â230 million, making it a commercial success.

If you are a fan of Spider-Man or superhero movies in general, you should definitely check out The Amazing Spider-Man. It is a fun and thrilling adventure that reimagines the origin story of one of the most iconic comic book characters ever created.
  
The Amazing Spider-Man also explores the themes of identity, responsibility, and family that are essential to the Spider-Man mythos. Peter struggles with his dual life as a student and a superhero, as well as his quest to find out the truth about his parents. He also learns the hard way that with great power comes great responsibility, a lesson that is taught by his beloved Uncle Ben, who meets a tragic fate. Peter also forms a bond with Dr. Connors, who becomes a father figure to him before turning into his enemy. Gwen, on the other hand, is more than just a love interest; she is a smart and brave young woman who helps Peter in his fight against the Lizard and stands up to her father, who distrusts Spider-Man.
 
The film also features some impressive action scenes that showcase Spider-Man's agility, strength, and web-slinging abilities. The film uses a combination of practical effects and CGI to create realistic and thrilling sequences that put the audience in Spider-Man's point of view. Some of the highlights include Spider-Man's first encounter with the Lizard in the sewers, his rescue of a boy from a burning car on a bridge, and his final showdown with the Lizard on top of Oscorp Tower. The film also pays homage to some of the iconic moments from the comics and previous films, such as Spider-Man's upside-down kiss with Gwen and his use of web-shooters instead of organic webbing.
 
The Amazing Spider-Man is not without its flaws, however. Some critics and fans have pointed out that the film rehashes some of the same plot points from the original Spider-Man film, such as Peter's origin story, Uncle Ben's death, and Spider-Man's conflict with the police. Some have also argued that the film was unnecessary and too soon after the previous trilogy, which was still fresh in many people's minds. Some have also complained that the film's villain, the Lizard, was not very compelling or memorable, and that his design was too humanoid and lacked a snout. Some have also found some plot holes and inconsistencies in the film's story, such as how Peter got his powers from a spider bite that apparently did not affect anyone else.
